# TM-TAS
TrackMania A01-Race TAS script. [See Here for more info.](https://youtu.be/-_e2jgFKHUg)
## HOW TO USE
#### Requirements:
- Python 3.5 or above
- The library pynput **(for linux users)**
- The library pyKey **(for windows users)**\
I have no idea how it goes on Mac, sorry.

#### How to launch:
- Open TrackMania and open A01-Race
**Optional** : If you just want to run the program one time, replace the `while` by a `if` in the program.
- Switch windows and launch the program with
  - `python WINDOWS_TAS-Script.py` for windows users
  - `python3 TAS-Script.py` for linux users
- You now have 4 seconds to go back into TrackMania. The script will do inputs forever unless you stop it manually, or if you do the optional step.
